# Courtain speed

## Some know data
https://github.com/srozum/film_camera_tester/wiki/Curtains-Travel-Times


Normally the courtain speed in m/sec is the same as the flash sincro speed.
As at the syncro speed only the first courtain is fully open for the entire time of the exposure. It's the slower speed without delays systems


## Teoric

|Camera   |travel time ms  |speed cm/s  |syncro speed |syncro time |notes  |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Leica  |18   | 20  |   |   |
|Fed 2a |33   |  11 |1/25   |40  |   |
|Fed 5  |   |  | 1/30  |33 | |

## Measured 

|Camera  |speed |syncro |travel time ms|speed cm/s  | notes  |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Fed 2  |1/25 |yes |15|22|
|Fed 5  |1/30 |yes |8.6|42|
|Fed 5  |1/125 |no |10|36|


## Leica

courtain travel time is about 18 ms, about 2000 mm/s 20 cm/sec

A typical Leica-type horizontal FP shutter for a 35 mm camera, as perfected in the 1954 Leica M3 (West Germany), is designed to pass a 36 mm wide film gate in 18 ms (2 meters per second).

Supports speed range from 1 to 1/1000 second.

 A minimum 2 mm wide slit provides an effective shutter speed of up to 1/1000 second. 
 
 The maximum flash sync speed is also limited because the slit is only fully open to the film gate (36 mm wide or more), allowing flash exposures of up to 1/60 second to X sync (nominal; 18 ms = 1/55). increase.
 
 Actual maximum value. In practice, using a 40 mm slit to account for variability gives a speed of 1/50 sec 1/3 stop. 

## Fed / Zorki
Fed/ Zorki first courtain travel time is about 33 ms, about 1100 mm/s 11 cm/sec
